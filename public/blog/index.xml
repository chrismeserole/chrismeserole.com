      <description>In 1936, the Literary Digest infamously predicted a landslide win for Alf Landon over FDR. In 1948, Gallup even more infamously had Dewey decisively besting Truman. And now, in 2016, yet another reckoning: &amp;ldquo;Clinton Trumps Trump&amp;rdquo; has yielded to &amp;ldquo;Trump Triumphs.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>There was a great panel at Brookings this week on counter-terrorism and the future of global jihadism, hosted by Will McCants and featuring Ambassador Kaidanow, Dan Byman, and Bruce Riedel. (If you missed it, the audio is here.)
Now that I have a minute, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d offer up a few quick thoughts in response:
 We&amp;rsquo;re still in need of new ways to evaluate foreign policy success. At one point there was a conversation about whether our foreign policy has made us safer since September 2001.</description>
