I use [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to build this site locally, and [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org) to upload it to Amazon s3. Eventually I may also push the site to Amazon's CDN, but for now the site seems plenty fast enough.

The fonts used are [Lato](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato) and [Ubuntu](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Ubuntu). 

The design is adapted from the [Casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper) theme.

### Hardware

I predominantly use a Macbook, but I also have a custom-built desktop that runs both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 13.04).
