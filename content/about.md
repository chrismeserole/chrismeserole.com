I'm a Fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution and Research Director of the Brookings Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative. 

I [focus](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/chris-meserole/) primarily on advanced technologies and global security. My research and thoughts have appeared in the New Yorker, New York Times, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Wired, Scientific American, and other publications.
