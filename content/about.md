I'm a fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where I research violent extremism and emerging technology. My work has been featured in the New Yorker, Vox, and other publications.

I have a B.A. from Harvard, have an M.Div. from Yale Divinity School, and a Ph.D. in computational political science from the University of Maryland.
