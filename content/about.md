I'm a fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on A.I., emerging technology, digital governance, and global security. My current research focuses on how governments and civil society can harness A.I. and emerging technology while preserving democratic norms and values. Previously I researched how interpretable machine learning can be used to improve public policy.

I regularly brief technology leaders and government officials in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and my work has appeared or been featured in numerous publications, including the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, and Foreign Policy.
