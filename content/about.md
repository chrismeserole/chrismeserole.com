I'm a Fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution and Deputy Director of the Brookings Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative. My research focuses on the intersection of emerging technology and international and domestic security. How do we ensure that new technologies empower democratic regimes rather than authoritarian ones? And how do we prevent them from leading to greater war and violence, rather than peace and security? From disinformation campaigns to autonomous weapons, modern technologies have placed longstanding institutions and policies under immense strain. My recent and upcoming work attempts to point a way forward. 

I've been fortunate enough to study at Harvard, Yale, and the University of Maryland. My work has appeared or been featured in numerous publications, including the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Wired, and others.
