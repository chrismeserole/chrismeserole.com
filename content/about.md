I think a lot about religion, peace, and conflict, and how American foreign policy can best address religious violence. My research has been featured in the New Yorker, Vox, and other publications.

I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. I have a B.A. from Harvard and an M.Div. from Yale Divinity School.
