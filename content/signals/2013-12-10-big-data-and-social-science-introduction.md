Big datasets are increasingly common in social science today, and understandably generating a lot of excitement.

However, for anyone just beginning to work with such data, the task of merely managing large datasets -- let alone analyzing them -- can be daunting. 

Since I've been working a lot lately with relatively big datasets, I thought I'd offer up a series of posts here on how to go about dealing with them. Although I'm not a computer scientist, hopefully anyone just starting out will find the overview useful. 

The series runs as follows:

* [Part I: The I/O Problem, or Why Big Data Takes Forever to Process](http://chrismeserole.com/signals/the-i-o-problem-or-why-big-data-takes-forever-to-process)

* [Part II: Big Data on the Desktop](http://chrismeserole.com/signals/big-data-on-the-desktop)

* [Part III: Big Data in the Cloud](http://chrismeserole.com/signals/big-data-in-the-cloud) 

* [Tutorial: Parsing GDELT with Spark/Shark on EC2](http://chrismeserole.com/signals/shark-spark-gdelt-tutorial)

If you have any corrections or suggestions for the series, [please be in touch](http://chrismeserole.com/contact/).
