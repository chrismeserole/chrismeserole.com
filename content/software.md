I've worked on several public pieces of software: 

- [obsval()](https://github.com/chrismeserole/obsval/) is an R package that aims to make it much easier to calculate predicted effects in R, particularly when using observed covariate values for generalized linear models. It's based on [Hanmer and Kalkan (2013)][hanmer] and is under active development.

- [gbNgram()](https://github.com/chrismeserole/gbNgram/) is an R package that fetches Google Books Ngrams data, and makes it possible to plot joint frequencies across cognate terms.

- [Lark](https://github.com/chrismeserole/lark) is a static site generator written in Python. It can execute Python and R code embedded in posts, even allowing you to shift between languages within a post. 

- [JREGS](https://github.com/chrismeserole/jregs) is a statistical software suite written entirely in Javascript that can be run in the browser.
