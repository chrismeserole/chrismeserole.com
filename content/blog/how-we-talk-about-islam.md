At the [town hall][politifact] presidential debate in St. Louis this past fall, a Muslim-American woman asked Donald Trump whether his comments on Islam betrayed an anti-Muslim bias. Not surprisingly, Trump replied with a central tenet of his platform: he alone would save us from "radical Islamic terrorists," for he alone was willing to utter the phrase.

The peculiar logic of that position begs any number of questions. But the one I keep coming back to is whether it reflects a broader shift in how we talk about Muslims altogether. How unusual is Trump's language? How much of its appeal lies not so much in that it is new, but newly familiar? 

To get a feel for this, I took a look recently at how references to Muslims have changed in Google Books. More specifically, I checked how often a set of ten cultural and violent terms appeared in Google Books between 1908 and 2008. The terms are listed below:

<figure>

<table class="casper-table">
<caption>Table 1: Cultural and Violent Muslim Terms</caption>

<thead><tr class=""><th>List</th><th class="">Terms</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td><em>Cultural</em></td><td class="">Muslim writer, Muslim scholar, Muslim scientist, Muslim theologian, Muslim philosopher, Muslim poet, Muslim author, Muslim artist, Muslim architect, Muslim historian</td></tr>
 <tr><td><em>Violent</em></td><td class="">Muslim extremist, Muslim terrorist, Muslim militant, Muslim guerrilla, Muslim insurgent, Muslim rebel, Muslim soldier, Muslim fighter, Muslim revolutionary</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</figure>

However, I didn't just check the terms in Table 1 alone. Since language often shifts subtly over time, I also looked at how often close variants of each term appeared too. For example, the cultural data doesn't just include how often *Muslim writer* appears in a given year, but also *Moslem writer*, *Islamic writer*, and *Islamist writer* too --- as well as the plural of each phrase. 

The resulting data isn't perfect, but it gives a good sense of how descriptions of Muslims have changed over time. Here's a plot showing how likely you would be to encounter at least one of the ten cultural or violent terms in a given year:

<figure>

<figcaption><h4>Figure 1: Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008.</h4> Each line shows how likely you would be to encounter a variant of one of the violent or cultural terms in Table 1, if you were to open a book from a given year at random.</figcaption>  
</figure>

As Figure 1 illustrates, for most of the twentieth century English-language readers were more likely to encounter references to Muslim scholars and artists than Muslim insurgents. Indeed, if you were to randomly choose a book published between the 1940s and 1960s, you would be six times more likely to encounter a phrase like *Muslim writer* than one like *Muslim soldier*.

To make the movement a clearer, Figure 2 breaks out three common cultural and violent terms individually:

<figure>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-mixed6-color3-a.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
<figcaption><h4>Figure 2: Select Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008.</h4> Each line shows how likely you would be to encounter a given Muslim term (or its variant) if you were to open a book from a given year at random.</figcaption>  
</figure>

Note that you see the same separation mid-century, followed by a brief spike and gradual convergence after the Iranian revolution in 1979. 

That said, there is one caveat to the graphs above. The Arabic term *mujahid* is often either translated as *jihadi* or *jihadist*, or left untranslated altogether --- and as a result, it's not getting picked up in the list of violent terms above. \[2\] 

Consequently, I also compiled data on how often *mujahid*, *jihadi*, and *jihadist* appear in Google Books, as well as the plural of each. Figure 3 is the same as Figure 1, but with data on *jihadist* and its variants included: 

<figure>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-jihadist-combined-a.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
<figcaption><h4>Figure 3: Muslim and Jihadist Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008.</h4> The data for "Cultural Terms" is identical to Figure 1.  However, "Violent Terms" also includes the frequency of "jihadist" and its cognates.</figcaption>  
</figure>

Don't let the scale of Figure 3 fool you. The graph still tells the same basic story as Figure 1, just with a more dramatic ending. Throughout the British colonial era and even beyond, English-language readers were more likely to encounter descriptions of Muslims that were cultural rather than violent. Then from the Iranian revolution and Afghan-Soviet war on, the terms were effectively at parity. Finally, the usage of violent terms then rises dramatically in the early and mid-2000s, led by a spike in usage of jihadist terms. 

Figure 3 suggests that that spike is significant. However, because the terms are aggregated, it doesn't provide a clear illustration of how *jihadist* changes over time, particularly as compared to other individual terms. Accordingly, here's the exact same graph as Figure 2, but with *jihadist* and its variants added in: 

<figure>

<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-mixed7-color3-a.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
<figcaption><h4>Figure 4: Muslim and Jihadist Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008.</h4> The data here is identical to Figure 2, except there is also a line for "jihadist" and its cognates.</figcaption>  
</figure>

How significant is the spike in usage of *jihadist*? As late as the 1990s, it's still occurring on the same scale as the other terms. Then over the next decade it increases tenfold -- while the other terms, relatively speaking, barely increase at all. 

In fact, the spike is striking enough that initially I thought it might owe to a bias in Google Books. As a result, I ran a [similar query][nyt lab] on the same terms in the New York Times. The Times only gives data on the percentage of articles that contain a given term, so Figure 5 is a bit different in that it shows article frequencies rather than term frequencies. 

[nyt lab]: http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=jihadists

Nonetheless, the graph is roughly similar:

<figure>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/nyt-jihadist8-5color-c.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
<figcaption><h4>Figure 5: Muslim Terms in the New York Times, 1975-2015.</h4> The graph shows the percentage of articles published by the <em>Times</em> that include a given term or its cognate. 
</figure>

As Figure 5 shows, there's a noticeable uptick in references to Muslim or Islamic militants from the late 1980s through early 2000s. Then, in line with the Google Books data, there's a rapid spike in the usage of *jihadists* --- first during the Iraqi insurgency, and then again, and even more dramatically, during the recent Syrian civil war.

In a sense the Times data is no less remarkable than the Google Books data. Prior to 1999 the word *jihadist* had never appeared in print in the Times at all. Less than twenty years later, it was appearing in more than one article per day.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

What the Times and Google Books data suggest is that there has in fact been a shift in how we talk about Muslims, and that that shift has largely taken place over the recent past. Twenty years ago, if you were to open a book at random, you'd be roughly as likely to read about a Muslim philosopher as a Muslim militant. Today you'd be much more likely to read about the latter --- and more likely still to read about a "jihadist."

At issue is whether that shift is a problem. As I noted above, individuals who do not know Muslims personally are more likely to hold anti-Muslims views. So if the media are increasingly describing Muslims in terms of violence, then it's hardly surprising that individuals who only learn about Muslims through the media would view them more unfavorably. Where Islamophobia is concerned, this suggests the solution lies in less coverage of violence carried out by Muslims.

However, we have also good reason to want the media to report on political violence, including the identities and ideologies of its perpetrators. From this perspective, to the extent that violence carried out by self-identifying Muslims has in fact increased, we should actually welcome an increase in violent descriptions of Muslims. 

In the regard, the million-dollar question is this: to what extent has the increase in descriptions of Muslim violence matched reality? Or put differently, how much of the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment owes to objective reporting of violence by Muslims, and how much to overly-sensationalized reporting of that violence? 

The answer to that question will go a long way in determining how best to reduce Islamophobia. Obviously part of the solution, no matter what, is to increase engagement with Muslim cultures more broadly. But if biased coverage is the bigger issue, then that suggests there's a lot of other low-hanging fruit too. Plainly reporting on religious violence, in a way that's ethical and responsible, cannot be too much to ask.

<!--
The riving the change in their beliefs. The media those individuals On the one hand, we have good reason to want the media to report on political violence, including the identities and ideologies of its perpetrators. On the other, we also have good reason not to want anti-Muslim attitudes to take root. Yet if the media accurately reports an increase in violence carried out by self-described Muslims, then Americans who do not know any Muslims --- and who rely solely on the media to inform their beliefs about them --- may view Muslims more unfavorably as a result. 

How to square that circle is, in my view, the central challenge when it comes to reducing Islamophobia. No doubt part of the solution is getting the media to report accurately and responsibly in the first place, so that it refrains both from over-emphasizing or sensationalizing acts of violence by Muslims. Beyond that though two other issues that need to be addressed as well.

First, the increase in violent descriptions of Muslims primarily coincides with violence abroad, yet anti-Muslim attitudes are rising in the United States. We clearly need to do a better job explaining and contextualizing the local nature of most violence abroad, even when it is carried out by transnational groups like Al-Qaeda or ISIS. 

Second, however much references to Muslim violence are justified by current events, references to Muslim culture have clearly not kept pace. Our media hangs on every new decree from an Osama Bin Laden or Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, but the latest release of a film by, say, Mohammad Malas receives little to no attention. (This is to say nothing of how Muslims are actually portrayed in Hollywood.) 

The rise in anti-Muslim sentiment owes primarily to the information we circulate about Muslims to those who don't know any. So long as we engage with Muslim communities primarily in terms of violence, it shouldn't come as a surprise if anti-Muslim sentiment continue to rise.

<!-- Third, I wonder whether "jihadist", as an analytical concept, has outlived its usefuless. Salafi-jihadism certainly constitutes a distinct strain of modern Islamic thought, as Shiraz Maher's [excellent new book][Shiraz book] demonstrates. But outside the academy, the term has become borderline tautological, to the point where it now seems to encompass every Muslim with a gun. Worse still, because the term conjures the specter of violence more so than its incidence, I suspect the term is more likely to inflame anti-Muslim sentiment than other descriptors. -->

<h6>NOTES</h6>

[1] Although each individual term is somewhat arbitrary, the lists themselves are comprehensive enough to capture how "cultural" and "violent" descriptions have varied over time. Further, unlike [more sophisticated methods][scholar link] for measuring language, using joint frequencies in this way are  a much cheaper and quicker option.
