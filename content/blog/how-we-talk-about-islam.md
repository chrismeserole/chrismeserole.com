Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed he alone could save us from "radical Islamic terrorists" -- for he alone was willing to utter the phrase itself.

[politifact]: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-clinton-wont-use-term-radical-islamist-terro/

The peculiar logic of that claim begs any number of questions. Foremost among them, though, is why it worked: did Trump's rhetoric on Islam and violence reflect a broader shift in how we talk about Muslims altogether?

To get a feel for that, I took a look recently at how references to Muslims have changed over time.  I didn't control for violence, and I didn't link the references directly to Trump's rhetoric. But shifts in those references alone tell an interesting story.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

I started by checking how often a set of ten cultural and violent terms appeared in Google Books between 1908 and 2008. The terms are listed in Table 1. Since the terms are all grammatically equivalent, they provide a decent way to compare how references to Muslims have changed over time.

(Further, to guard against subtle shifts in spelling and usage, I also looked at close variants of each term. For instance, I didn't just look up how often *Muslim writer* appears in a given year; I also also checked how frequently *Moslem writer*, *Islamic writer*, and *Islamist writer* appear too, as well as the plural of each phrase.)

</tbody></table>

Once I'd gathered data on each phrase, I compiled joint frequencies for all cultural and violent phrases. The plot below shows how likely you would be to encounter one of the ten cultural or violent phrases if you were to randomly open a book published in a given year. As you can see, there's an fascinating arc in the data: 

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 1: Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-combined-green-blue-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

For most of the twentieth century, English-language readers were more likely to encounter references to Muslim scholars and artists than Muslim insurgents. Indeed, if you were to randomly choose a book published between the 1940s and 1960s, you would be six times more likely to encounter a phrase like *Muslim writer* than one like *Muslim soldier*. Not until the end of the century do the frequences converge. 

However, there is at least one caveat to the plot above. The Arabic term *mujahid* is often either translated as *jihadi* or *jihadist*, or left untranslated altogether --- and as a result, it's not getting picked up in the list of violent terms above. \[1\] 

Consequently, I also compiled data for *jihadists* and its variants as well. Here's the same graph as above, but with that data included:

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 2: Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-jihadist-combined-a-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

Don't let the scale of Figure 2 fool you. The graph still tells the same basic story as Figure 1, just with a more dramatic ending. Throughout the British colonial era and even beyond, English-language readers were more likely to encounter descriptions of Muslims that were cultural rather than violent. Then from the Iranian revolution and Afghan-Soviet war on, the terms were effectively at parity. Finally, the usage of violent terms rises dramatically in the early and mid-2000s, led by a spike in usage of jihadist terms. 

Figure 2 suggests that that spike is significant. However, because the data are aggregated, it doesn't how *jihadist* changes relative to other terms. 

Accordingly, below I break several leading cultural and violent terms out individually:

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 3: Muslim and Jihadist Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-mixed7-color3-a-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

Note the compressed band at the bottom through about 1980. Up to that point, the variants of *jihadist* always stay within the same scale as the other Muslim phrases, even as they become increasingly popular. Then comes the Afghan-Soviet war, and, later, the attacks of 2001. After that, the use of *jihadist* spikes fivefold, and shifts the entire scale of the plot dramatically. 

That shift is striking enough that initially I thought there might be a bias in Google Books. As a result, I ran a [similar query][nyt lab] on the same terms in the New York *Times*. The *Times* only gives data on the percentage of articles that contain a given term, so Figure 4 is a bit different in that it shows article frequencies rather than term frequencies. 

[nyt lab]: http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=jihadists

Nonetheless, the graph is roughly similar:

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 4: Muslim Terms in the New York Times, 1975-2015</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/nyt-jihadist8-5color-c-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

As a newspaper focused on current events, the *Times* rarely uses cultural descriptions at all. Not surprisingly, however, there's a noticeable uptick in violent references to Muslims from the late 1980s through early 2000s, with *militants* being the prefered term. Then, in line with the Google Books data, there's a rapid spike in the usage of *jihadists* --- first during the Iraqi insurgency, and then again, and even more dramatically, during the recent Syrian civil war.

In a sense the *Times* data is no less remarkable than the Google Books data. Prior to 1999 the word *jihadist* had never appeared in print in the *Times* at all. Less than twenty years later, it was appearing in more than one article per day. 

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>


What the *Times* and Google Books data suggest is that there has in fact been a shift in how we talk about Muslims, and that that shift has largely taken place over the recent past. Twenty years ago, if you were to open a book at random, you'd be roughly as likely to read about a Muslim philosopher as a Muslim militant. Today you'd be much more likely to read about the latter --- and more likely still to read about a *jihadist.*

In that light, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that Trump's rhetoric on Islam has resonated so broadly. Fifty years ago, "radical Islamic terrorist" would have been an odd turn of phrase. Now it sounds familiar.

To my mind, the question is whether that shift is a problem. The rise in references to violent Muslims is clearly related, for instance, to acts of violence carried out by self-identifying Muslims. Although those references are not perfectly correlated with acts of violence, for the sake of argument, let's assume they are. In that case, how concerned should we be not so much that Trump uses the language he does, but that his audience is now so much more accustomed to hearing it? What does it mean that cultural references to Muslims haven't kept pace?

Such questions don't admit easy answers. The relationship between acts of violence and descriptions of violence is always fraught, and doubly so when religion is involved. But if we're to avoid Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric leading directly to, say, a Muslim registry, we likely need to find new and better ways of talking about Muslims -- and the violence carried out in their name.

[1] I also looked at a handful of more archaic phrases that describe Islamic actors, such as "mad Mullah," but none that I looked at significantly change the results.
