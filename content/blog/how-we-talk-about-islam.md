Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump claimed he alone could save us from "radical Islamic terrorists" -- if for no other reason than that he alone was willing to utter the phrase itself.

[politifact]: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-clinton-wont-use-term-radical-islamist-terro/

The peculiar logic of that claim begs any number of questions. But the one I keep coming back to is whether it reflects a broader shift in how we talk about Muslims altogether. How common is Trump's language? How much of its appeal lies not so much in that it is shocking or new, but instead, if anything, newly familiar? 

To get a feel for this, I took a look recently at how references to Muslims have changed over time. In particular, I checked how often a set of ten cultural and violent terms appeared in Google Books between 1908 and 2008. The terms are listed below:

<figure>

<table class="casper-table">
<caption>Table 1: Cultural and Violent Muslim Terms</caption>

<thead><tr class=""><th>List</th><th class="">Terms</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td><em>Cultural</em></td><td class="">Muslim writer, Muslim scholar, Muslim scientist, Muslim theologian, Muslim philosopher, Muslim poet, Muslim author, Muslim artist, Muslim architect, Muslim historian</td></tr>
 <tr><td><em>Violent</em></td><td class="">Muslim extremist, Muslim terrorist, Muslim militant, Muslim guerrilla, Muslim insurgent, Muslim rebel, Muslim soldier, Muslim fighter, Muslim revolutionary</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</figure>

Because the phrases are grammatically equivalent, they provide a decent way to compare how references to Muslims have changed. Further, because I also included close variants of each term, the results are also fairly robust to subtle shifts in language. (For instance, I didn't just look up how often *Muslim writer* appears in a given year; I also also checked how frequently *Moslem writer*, *Islamic writer*, and *Islamist writer* appear too, as well as the plural of each phrase.)

The plot below groups the ten cultural and violent phrases together. What each line shows is how likely you would be to encounter one of the ten phrases, or their variants, if you were to randomly open a book published in a given year. As you can see, there's an interesting story in the data:

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 1: Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-combined-green-blue-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

For most of the twentieth century, English-language readers were more likely to encounter references to Muslim scholars and artists than Muslim insurgents. Indeed, if you were to randomly choose a book published between the 1940s and 1960s, you would be six times more likely to encounter a phrase like *Muslim writer* than one like *Muslim soldier*.

However, there is at least one caveat to the graphs above. The Arabic term *mujahid* is often either translated as *jihadi* or *jihadist*, or left untranslated altogether --- and as a result, it's not getting picked up in the list of violent terms above. \[1\] 

Consequently, I also compiled data on how often *mujahid*, *jihadi*, and *jihadist* appear in Google Books, as well as the plural of each. Figure 2 is the same as Figure 1, but with data on *jihadist* and its variants included: 

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 2: Muslim Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-jihadist-combined-a-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

Don't let the scale of Figure 2 fool you. The graph still tells the same basic story as Figure 1, just with a more dramatic ending. Throughout the British colonial era and even beyond, English-language readers were more likely to encounter descriptions of Muslims that were cultural rather than violent. Then from the Iranian revolution and Afghan-Soviet war on, the terms were effectively at parity. Finally, the usage of violent terms rises dramatically in the early and mid-2000s, led by a spike in usage of jihadist terms. 

Figure 2 suggests that that spike is significant. However, because the terms are aggregated, it doesn't how *jihadist* and its variants changes over time, particularly as compared to other individual terms. Accordingly, here's the exact same graph as Figure 2, but with *jihadist* and its variants added in: 

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 3: Muslim and Jihadist Terms in Google Books, 1908-2008</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/gb-ngram-mixed7-color3-a-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

Note the compressed band at the bottom through about 1980. Up to that point, the variants of *jihadist* always stay within the same scale as the other Muslim phrases, even as they become increasingly popular. Then comes the Afghan-Soviet war, and, later, the attacks of 2001. After that, the use of *jihadist* spikes fivefold, and shifts the entire scale of the plot dramatically. 

That shift is striking enough that initially I thought there might be a bias in Google Books. As a result, I ran a [similar query][nyt lab] on the same terms in the New York *Times*. The *Times* only gives data on the percentage of articles that contain a given term, so Figure 4 is a bit different in that it shows article frequencies rather than term frequencies.

Nonetheless, the graph is roughly similar:

<figure>
<div class="caption"><h4>Fig. 4: Muslim Terms in the New York Times, 1975-2015</h4></div>
<img src="/images/how-we-talk-muslims/nyt-jihadist8-5color-c-no-title.svg" alt="Google Ngram of selected Muslim bigrams." />
</figure>

As Figure 4 shows, there's a noticeable uptick in references to Muslim or Islamic militants from the late 1980s through early 2000s. Then, in line with the Google Books data, there's a rapid spike in the usage of *jihadists* --- first during the Iraqi insurgency, and then again, and even more dramatically, during the recent Syrian civil war.

In a sense the *Times* data is no less remarkable than the Google Books data. Prior to 1999 the word *jihadist* had never appeared in print in the *Times* at all. Less than twenty years later, it was appearing in more than one article per day.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

What the *Times* and Google Books data suggest is that there has in fact been a shift in how we talk about Muslims, and that that shift has largely taken place over the recent past. Twenty years ago, if you were to open a book at random, you'd be roughly as likely to read about a Muslim philosopher as a Muslim militant. Today you'd be much more likely to read about the latter --- and more likely still to read about a *jihadist.*

In that light, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that Trump's rhetoric on Islam has resonated so broadly. The popular discussion of Muslims has shifted markedly, and Trump's language reflects that shift. Fifty years ago, "radical Islamic terrorist" would have been an odd turn of phrase. Now it sounds familiar.

To my mind, the question now is whether authors and journalists see that as a problem. Assume that the rise in violent descriptions of Muslims tracks perfectly with actual patterns of violence. Even in that case, how concerned should we be not so much that Trump uses the language he does, but that his audience is so accustomed to hearing it?

[1] I also looked at a handful of more archaic phrases that describe Islamic actors, such as "mad Mullah," but none that I looked at significantly change the results.
