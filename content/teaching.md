During the fall 2013 semester I'll be helping to teach GVPT 729a, "Special Topics in Quantitative Political Analysis, Advanced MLE."

If you need anything, just [email me](http://chrismeserole.com/contact) or stop by the LeFrak Labs on Wednesdays from 1pm to 2:30pm.

You can find my notes and code for the class [here](http://chrismeserole.com/mle-notes).
